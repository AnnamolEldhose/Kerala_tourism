      <h2>Pathanamthitta</h2>
      <p class="lead text-justify mx-5 my-3">A hilly province of pristine splendour, the district of Pathanamthitta is hailed as the headquarters of pilgrim worship in Kerala. Three rivers course through its prosperous terrains comprising natural divisions of the lowlands, the midlands and the highlands. Interspersed with temples, rivers, mountain ranges and coconut groves, more than fifty per cent of the total area of this region is covered by forests. Pathanamthitta has been dubbed a Heritage Village as it attracts visitors from all over the world for its spectacular water fiestas, religious shrines and cultural training centres. Pathanamthitta is also home to the unique AranmulaKannadi - metal mirrors that are meticulously handcrafted and the VasthuVidyaGurukulam, a village which practices the ancient Indian school of architecture.</p>

            <p class="card-text text-justify">Perunthenaruvy waterfalls is a picturesque tourist destination that is lesser known to the outside world. Set on the Western Ghats of the Sahyadri Range, this waterfall, known for its width rather than its height, offers a relaxing and rejuvenating ambiance to its visitors. The name “Perunthenaruvi” translates to “Huge Honey Stream”. As it mentions honey, it is obvious that a lot of bees and beehives are found surrounding the waterfall. Perunthenaruvy, which originates from the lush green forests of Sabarimala, with two shores namely Kudamurutty and Vechoochira, and two waterfalls called Panamkudantha and Padivathil, flows to merge with the sacred river Pamba. A walk of 5 minutes or a trek of 20 minutes through tea plantations will get you to the waterfalls here.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Valparai</h5>
            <p class="card-text text-justify">Valparai is a tourist destination located on the border of Kerala, and primarily near Pollachi in Tamilnadu. Before speaking about the destination, it is best to start with the ride to the top. One can reach the summit of the Valaparai tourism region after some hilarious twists and turns through the 40 hairpin bends surrounded by dense plantations. Breaking through the snowy mists that seem to cover the roads is adventurous as well as breath-taking. Set on the pristine Anaimalai Hill range of the wavy Western Ghats, this spot showcases its charm with the lush greenery all around, scenic dams, and roaring waterfalls.</p>
